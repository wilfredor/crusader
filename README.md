> **Food:** is necessary to keep your army fed and strong.<br>
> **Gold:** ? <br>
> **Water:** is necessary to keep your people hydrated and healthy. <br>

# Game development

The game is developed turn-by-turn and the player must make strategic decisions to expand their territory and maintain their people.
The game grid is hexagonal and each hexagon represents a territory with different characteristics, such as terrain type, available resources, and more.
The game has a technology tree that allows the player to evolve and improve their skills and resources. The player can research new technologies using their resources and unlock new skills and improvements.

# User interface

The game will include a user interface (HUD) that will display terrain information, resources, and more. This will allow the player to make strategic decisions more effectively.
The HUD should include:
* A map of the hexagonal grid showing conquered and unconquered territories
* A resource bar showing the available amount of water, food, and iron
* A technology menu showing available technologies to research and those that have already been unlocked
* An options menu allowing the player to save and load games, adjust settings, and more.

# Aesthetics
The aesthetics of the game will be pixelated and nostalgiciac. It is expected that the game will have a retro and timeless appearance.
It is expected that the game's graphic design will include:
* Pixelated characters and units
* Pixelated environments and game elements
* A color palette coherent with the medieval theme

# Open source and documentation
Crusader is an open source game and will have documentation on a GitHub wiki.
It is expected that the programmer will follow the documentation provided on the GitHub wiki to ensure the quality and coherence of the game.
The documentation should include:
* Detailed instructions on how to install and run the game
* Detailed descriptions of each game component and how they interact with each other
* Instructions for contributing to the game's code and submitting pull requests

# Used technologies
It is expected that the programmer will use GitHub and C# and [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/) to develop the game.
It is expected that the programmer will follow best programming practices and use an object-oriented development approach to organize the game's code.
