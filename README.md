> **Lose:** Be conquered by the church in all territories.

> **Lose:** Completely exhaust any of the necessary resources (water, food, iron).

# Resources

# Game development

The game is developed turn-by-turn and the player must make strategic decisions to expand their territory and maintain their people.
The game grid is hexagonal and each hexagon represents a territory with different characteristics, such as terrain type, available resources, and more.
The game has a technology tree that allows the player to evolve and improve their skills and resources. The player can research new technologies using their resources and unlock new skills and improvements.

# User interface (HUD)

The game will include a user interface (HUD) that will display terrain information, resources, and more. This will allow the player to make strategic decisions more effectively.
The HUD should include:
* A map of the hexagonal grid showing conquered and unconquered territories
